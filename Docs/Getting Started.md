Welcome to the documentation/workspace for FrogSwing.
These are just markdown files, but you'll want to install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

You'll also probably need to enable community plugins the first time you open it.


# Why Though?
This lets us keep our design docs, mind maps, task lists, and all that other good stuff right here in the repo. It's also better Trello, Jira, Notion, TickTick, Todoist, Miro, ClickUp, or any of those other kinds of things I've tried. 

Mostly because all the files are stored locally, so it's faster and less janky, but also due to the crazy level of customisation you can do to it. In my personal vault I have plugins ranging from a 3d dice roller, to a locally hosted batch transcription tool. Basically, we will be able to adapt it to our needs, whatever they may be. 

Also I don't like Jira.

# Overview
Obsidian's layout is pretty familiar. Basically browser windows that you can move around with a bit more flexibility.

Try creating a new tab with `Ctrl+T` and dragging it off to the side, to create a new pane.

Now I've got a split window with two files open. Or, you could have a few more than that:

![[Getting Started carried away.png]]

In the left sidebar, you can see all the files in our repo. I've set up a few visual tweaks to make it less messy. If you want to see the rest of the folder, click this cube...

![[Getting Started - show-hide unity.png]]

And they will appear at the bottom of the hierarchy.

Also here's some hotkeys you might find useful:

| Key            | Command                                                |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Ctrl+O`       | Open quick switcher                                    |
| `Ctrl+P`       | Open command palette                                   |
| `Ctrl+Shift+F` | Search all files in repo                               |
| `Alt+P`        | Open *[[Getting Started#Projects\|projects]]*          |
| `Alt+[, Alt+]` | Open side panes                                        |
| `Alt+Shift+D`  | Create a new *[[Getting Started#Excalidraw\|drawing]]* |
|                |                                                        |


# Layout
We've got a few folders here to work in:

*Docs* will of course contain our documentation. I've just put a few things into a rough folder structure for now cause I don't really know how we'll need to organise it.

*Workspaces* has a folder for each of us to put our notes/tasks/whatever in. It also has a shared folder for stuff like team meetings.

*Resources* is just for attachments and stuff.





# Plugins
Text files are cool but these plugins are useful for doing more project management stuff.

## Canvas
This is an official plugin that got added recently - basically a miro board that you can connect to all your notes. Click this embed to check it out.

![[Stuff from Miro.canvas]]
These don't sync in real time though. We could set that up but tbh I can't be bothered at the moment. 

## Projects
[Docs](https://github.com/marcusolsson/obsidian-projects)
This is a big plugin with a fair few features. Click this button to open it.

![[Getting Started - projects plugin.png]]

There's a few ways to view the information in here: this one is just a big calendar of our meeting notes.
![[Getting Started - projects.png]]



But there's also a level design project with a gallery view, kanban board, or table.

![[Getting Started - gallery.png|200]]![[Getting Started - kanban view.png|200]]![[Getting Started - table.png|200]]
[^click to expand]


When you open projects it will default to the Team Meetings area, but you can switch to a different one by choosing from this dropdown:

![[Getting Started - Changing Projects.png]]

I've also added a button to the ribbon menu to quickly open the level design project:
![[Getting Started - ribbon menu.png]]


## Kanban
[Docs](https://publish.obsidian.md/kanban/Obsidian+Kanban+Plugin)
Like I said, projects is more useful for big picture stuff, but if you want a kanban board for your own tasks, just right click a folder and select new kanban board.

![[Getting Started - kanbans.png]]

Here's what mine looks like. 
![[Getting Started - my kanban.png]]

If you accidentally open it as a regular text file, just press this button in the dropdown menu to bring it back.

## Excalidraw
[Docs](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin)
The last one I'll mention is excalidraw - basically a minimal vector editor/mind mapping thing. I reckon it'll be useful for level design or UI mockups for us.
