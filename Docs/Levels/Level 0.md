This is the main menu, which is technically a level and will teach the player about simple moving and tongue shooting

Since this is going to be the first interaction between the players and the core mechanics, will will either need some kind of pop-up (annoying), an asset in the world showing controls (better), or an intro 'prologue' thing (time consuming).

I reckon the best thing would be a simple in world sign with the controls printed on it. Maybe not even any text, just the picture of a left mouse click.
