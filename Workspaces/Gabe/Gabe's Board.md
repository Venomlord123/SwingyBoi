kanban-plugin: basic

---

## Ideas

- [ ] # Tongue audio<br><br>- should trigger a sound on activation - *bleh*<br>- also when connecting - *plap*<br>- also an unstick sound - *schlup*<br>- reeling/unreeling should have adaptive stuff


## To Do

- [ ] Audio Manager basics<br><br>- [ ] set up key functions<br>	- [ ] play a file<br>	- [ ] change volume<br>	- [ ] play/pause<br>- [ ] interface with unity audio<br>	- [ ] set up mixer<br>	- [ ] can you use ARCs yet?<br>- [ ] write audio settings to file?<br>- should probably use a different script like SettingsManager to handle that. Maybe work on a .json parsing system
